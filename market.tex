Consider a setting with multiple experts providing advice to a subject, who wishes to incentivize them to inform them of which of a set of available actions maximize the reward.
One natural way to attempt to do is by applying the machinery of prediction markets based on sequentially shared proper scoring rules, and only settlign the markets where actions are taken. Doing this in an incentive compatible manner for the experts is however incompatible with maintaining the subjects freedom to select the action that appears optimal ex-post (\cite{othman2010decision,  chen2014eliciting}, that is using the max decision rule. 
The core of the problem with using the machinery of prediction markets in the decision setting is that at the point where the mechanism has correct belief over the optimal action but not others, a expert  can profit by changing expected rewards to make optimal action appear worse than an action for which the expected reward can be corrected.


The guiding design criterion in this work is to restrict as little as possible the decision that the subject must take (maximizing their freedom) while still providing good incentives to the experts. No previous mechanisms in the literature can truthfully aggregate arbitrary signals over many experts in BNE. 

We first focus on a direct mechanism. Experts directly report their signals to the mechanism, which then uses them to compute the optimal action given the prior to output to the subject. This requires  the experts and the mechanism having access to a common bayesian prior, over the joint probabilities of the rewards, true signals, the output action and the response of the subject to a given output of the mechanism. There is a BNE that aggregates all information over $N$ experts, unlike the case in the previous mechanisms in the literature.
We then analyze a simple bid based variation of the mechansim, and provide a sufficient conditions on the signal structures where information can be fully aggregated; we further show that these conditions are sufficient to make truthfulness dominant incentive compatible.  



\section{Model}

We consider a single subject with access to $K$ possible choices, their outcomes are sufficiently characterized for the subject by a reward vector $R$ which is unobservable to the subject, where each element in $r_k$ corresponds to the reward the subject receives if he carries out the corresponding action in $K$ . We consider a set of $N$ experts, each of whom have access to some signal $s_i$ which are potentially informative about $R$, we use $S$ to denote the vector containing all signals.  $P$ denotes a prior distribution over $P(R|S) $ which is common knowledge.

\NDP{Does this seems worth noting at this point? it maps to mechanism design adn chen et al more clearly, but it doesnt add much light}  To map to the mechanism design literature the $P$ would be over states of the world in $\Omega$ and each state of the world consists of a agent type (complier probability and action outcome and the value (reward) a utility functin placed on it) and the signals of each expert)

A mechanism anounces a payment rule $p_i(r^*,a,c,S)$, with $p_i$ being the payment to expert $i$. We will denote by $\hat{c}^{*}$ the chosen action that maximizes the reward given the reported signals $\hat{S}$, and by $c^{*}$ the optimal choice given the true signals.
We seek a mechanism that  $c^{*} = \hat{c}^{*}$.

Each experts receives their signals $s_i$, and makes a reports $\hat{s}_i$ to the mechanism, which outputs a chosen action $c^{*}$.
The subject observes the action chosen by the mechanism $c$, and takes a (potentially different) action $a$. A reward $r^{*}$ is observed, and the mechanism makes the corresponding payments.



%There are n players, i = 1􏰸􏰷􏰷􏰷􏰸n. There is a finite set of states of the world, Ω, and a random variable (“security”) X : Ω → R. As in Aumann (1976), each player i receives information about the true state of the world, ω ∈ Ω, accord- ing to partition Πi of Ω (i.e., if the true state is ω, player i observes Πi(ω)). For notational convenience, without loss of generality, assume that the join (the coarsest common refinement) of partitions Π1􏰸􏰷􏰷􏰷􏰸Πn consists of single- ton sets; that is, for any two states ω1 ̸= ω2, there exists player i such that Πi(ω1) ̸= Πi(ω2). Π = (Π1􏰸􏰷􏰷􏰷􏰸Πn) is the partition structure. Players have a common prior distribution P over states in Ω.

An experts $i$ report is truthful when $\hat{s}_i=s_i$. A mechanism is incentive compatible when truthful reports maximize the payment experts receive and this holds for all experts. This can be in dominant strategies or in a bayesian nash equilibrium.

\section{Shared Reward Mechanism}

Here we explore a set of mechanisms based around the idea of sharing the rewards from the taken action with the experts.

\subsection{Share of Reward Mechanism}

Let us first consider a very basic direct mechanism, which will help us understand the model and the limitations that subjects freedom imposes. 
A simple mechanism that is strictly incentive compatible (in equilibrium) for an expert to reveal their signal when subjects are utility maximizers is to give all experts a share of the reward. Equivalently (in expectation) run a lottery after the reports are submitted that assigns a share of the reward to the expert that wins. 

In this case the signals may be arbitrary, the payment rule is invariant to them, and defined as $\pi_i  = (\alpha / N ) r^{*} $ with $\alpha < 1$. Note that we are not defining the payment rule to be conditional on the subjects actual action in any way. %In particular, it might naively seem appropiate to only give the share when the chosen action is the actual action carried out. 


\subsubsection{Limitations}
This mechanism is problematic in a number of ways

\begin{itemize}
\item it pays out even when experts signals are useless.
\item the entry of useless experts reduces the payment received by valuable ones or the budget needed by the mechanism.
\end{itemize}

Somewhat more formally we say a expert is useless, if where the expert able to force the action to be his choice, he would not improve the expected reward beyond picking the action that is the max expected utility in the common prior.

This motivates considering the next mechanism.


\section{Freedom and Limits to Defiance}

If we consider subjects with potentially unrestricted freedom, i.e. subjects are not necesarily expected reward maximizers, then the mechanism is not necesarily truthful, even for a single expert. 

\begin{eg}[total freedom yields bad incentives for a single expert]
	For example, consider a subject that has a prejudice in favour of treatment A, and so will take it unless the expected reward of treatment B is more than 10 utils highers. Consider a expert with access to a signal wich is an unbiased estimate of the rewards over both actions, receives a signal  that B reward is higher by 9 utils. The expert is strictly better off reporting that his signal has B as more than 10 better.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}[subjects who defy experts yield perverse incentives]
	More generically we can consider of an agent who does the oposite of what maximizes reward (the min decision rule), this creates incentives for experts to flip the ordering that their signals imply. 
\end{eg}

Thus, it can be seen that providing unrestricted freedom in the broadest sense to subjects makes the setting hopeless. 

One restriction on subjects freedom that is sufficient to allow (in the single expert setting) dominant strategy truthful mehcanism is \emph{no defiers}: assuming that all subjects are either utility maximizers (compliers) or have some action they will take irrespective of the reports of the experts (always takers or never takers in the binary setting).
This preserves substantial freedom, in that it is not required the subject known a priori that they will compliers, their realization of the always taker type could come after the mechanism has been run and before the action is taken. 

This can be somewhat relaxed, since the needed property it implies is that the mechansim choosing an action with higher expected reward if actually carried out leads to the expected reward conditional on the chosen action to be higher. Formaly the condition that is sufficient (\NDP{necesary?})

$E[ ^{*}|c_i]  >= E[ r^{*}|c_j] if E[ ^{*}|a_i]  >= E[ r^{*}|a_j]  \forall j \neq i \in K$ 



Note that under this assumption existing mechanisms for the many expert setting are not incentive compatible unless subjects can credibly commit to using a randomized strategy which places positive mass on dominated action (i.e. there are no ex-post incntive compatible mechanisms based on proper scoring rules and voiding given a no defiers assumption):

\begin{thm}
        Randomized decision rules are necesary for incentive compatible  scoring rule decision markets (SRDM)
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
	\cite{chen2014eliciting}
\end{proof}

In fact, it has been shown that

\begin{eg}[under SRDM with a utitlity maximizing subject an expert can always benefit from exaggerating the success probability of a suboptimal action]
	counterexample from \cite{othman2010decision}
\end{eg}


\begin{Corollaries}
	If a subject is free to either maximize their expected utility at decision time, or to have probability zero of taking some actions due to their revealed prices, then a SRDM is not IC for them.
\end{Corollary}


There is some extra flexibility more than no defiers which we should use, for example differential compliance rates for different actions, the mechanisms selects the action that most raises the reward not the one who has the highest reward (for exmaple a action that has the seccond highest reward but 1\% noncompliance might be chosen instead of one  that has 99\% noncompliance and the highest reward. No defiers buys us the extra part that chosen is the highest reward action, so makes life easier for the subject (if the noncpliance depened on the signals the expert receives a utility maximizing decision maker would have to consider other decision markets noncomplaince characteristics in the prior before deciding how to interpret the chosen action; this removes such ambiguities and doesn't seem to loose too much generality)


\section{A Direct Mechanism with Common Priors}

All agents know a common prior that gives full probability distribution of rewards over all posible signals, chosen actions and actual actions.

A direct VCG-style mechanism.

For each expert $i$, compute the optimal action to choose without using that experts report (i.e. marginalizing over the prior on signal $i$ signal), denote this action $\hat{c}_{-i}$ and it's expected reward 

$E[\hat{r}_{-i}] = E[ r| \hat{c}_{-i}, \bigcup \hat{s}_j  \forall j \neq i \in N]$

 The payment rule is announced as follows:

\[
    \pi_i = 
\begin{cases}
    r^{*} - E[\hat{r}_{-i}] ,& \text{if } \hat{c}_{-i} \neq c\\
    0,              & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

If a experts reports alter the chosen action then expert gets a payment proportional to the difference between the realized action and the expectation of the 

 Note that this doesnt change the expectation when reports are truthful, but it does when they are not; since the misreported signals can't in expectation increase the payoff when others are truthful, it is never optimal to manipulate when others are truthful. 


Each expert reports their signal, the mechanism calculates the action that maximizes the reward and chooses it. 
\NDP{is there a better way to notate this? maybe $S_{-i}$ to denote the joint signals off all the others?}


The difference between the received payoff and the payoff that would have been obtained in expectation if only the other experts reports had been taken into account , the payment rule is:

Note that such payments do not depend on the reported signal of agent $i$, instead they depend on the achieved outcome and the expected reward of the optimal action without using a given agents signal.

\DBA{It took me a while to notice that there are three quantities that are relevant: (1) received payoff, (2) expected payoff from using all agents reports except winner, (3) expected payoff from using all agents reports including winner. It seems only (1) and (2) are used -- and (3) is not. Worth emphasizing this more, since it also matters for noncompliance (comment below).}
\NDP{The winner is not a clearly defined notion in the signal reporting mechanism (as opposed to the bid based one). We could have them submit a bid too, and use the seccond highest bid, but the revelation priciple suggest this is unnecesary. 

OTOH the above mechanism has the problem that if my signal is bad news that makes all payoffs lower and changes the optimal action, I have to pay out (Not sure about this, does the marginalization over the prior make it wash out in expectation?) That is, if you didnt have my signal, you would assume that some share of the time I would be getting the bad signal and you would pick an even worst action. So ex-ante it is rational even if ex-post it is not.

The situation }


 
$\pi_i  = r^{*} - E[\hat{r}_{-i}] $


}

As presented this mechanism might hae unbounded payments and result in a net loss of utility for the decision maker.
This could lead to overpayments (paying more than the rewards of the experts), but you can scale the payments of the experts so that they are over some fraction of the total reward, and using the prior you can calibrate this to wokr out (TODO: less hand wavy)
\DBA{Provide argument that the rescaling component of the mechanism cannot be gamed}

\begin{eg}[bounding payments]

\end{eg}


\begin{lem}
	the rescaling component of the mechanism cannot be gamed
\end{lem}



\begin{lem}
	the only way a experts report affects their payments is via the chosen action.
\end{lem}

\begin{eg}[redundant experts]
	If you have two experts and they both observe the same signal, they both get outcome zero. \DBA{note: redundant experts get zero in expectation. If actual reward is more than predicted, then they all get paid; if it is less then they all get negative payments.}
\end{eg}



the experts have to have the potential for negative payoffs (even through the expected payoff in equilibrium is positive). Since the mchanism stoping the payments around zero would change the expectation. 


\subsection{Bayesian Nash Incentive Compatibility and Full Efficiency}

There is a  equilibrium where all experts maximize their payment by maximizing the probability that the action with the highest reward is taken; if all other reports are truthful and under a no defiers assumption then this is optimized by being truthful.


\begin{defn}[nash equilibrium]
	lala
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[bayesian nash equilibrium; BNE incentive compatibility]
	fala
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[dominant truthfulness]
	ftw
\end{defn}

The incentive compatibility here is only in one nash equilibrium, and not in dominant strategies. In particular, if another expert does not report their signal truthfully, an expert might maximize the reward by making a countervailing report that is not truthful, to cancel out the other untruthful expert. 

\begin{eg}[mechanism is not dominant-strategy incentive compatible]
	Consider a setting with a reward maximizing subject with probability 1, two possible actions, where two experts know with certainty that the rewards are $1,2$ and one of them reports $1,0$. A truthful report would lead to choosing the first action (the average of the two reports) with rewards of $1$ while a report of $0,2$ would cause the max to select the seccond action and obtain a reward of $2$.
\end{eg}

Also note that the payout to the in this example to the expert is positive it can triviall be made negative, so the expert does not make the countervailing report as it wouldnt maximize their payment; for example if the untruthful agent reports was $3,0$.

\begin{con}
	No mechanism can get around this (intuition; we are tyring to get as close to vcg as possible, and i dont see a way to get closer).
\end{con}
\DBA{proving a negative is hard; e.g. this paper is circumenting Chen's negative result}

\subsection{A sufficient condition for dominat truthfulness in reports}

in general the mechanism is not dominant truthful, since a trickster agent who inverts their reporrts would make the other agents try to compensate if possible, as seen above.
If the action chosen depends only on the signal of the highest type, (the type whose signal without using he other signals implies the highest reward for the optimaly chosen action) 

To see this, note that bidding the valuation conditional on their signal and winning is domminant strategy in the 

\subsection{Noncompliance and Incentive Compatibility}

For the same reassonsas before there is no dominant strategy incentive compatibility. 

A interesting question that arrises is how to handle the case where the action that is optimal given the reports is not the actual chosen action. Three natural strategies are:

\begin{itemize}
\item make payments irrespective. \DBA{I realized here that you're using (1) received payoff instead of (3) expected payoff. This seems problematic. E.g. if noncompliance leads to lower reward (which is presumably to be expected if experts know more than subject) then experts' payouts take a hit based on subject's capriciousness. This is especially problematic if payouts are negative due to subject's noncompliance.}
\NDP{I initially tried setting to void market if action nto followed, but this creates perverse incentives, where the subject might not follow the advice and receive a lower payoff to avoid payment. While your statements abotu the experts are true they (A) the prior taking into account noncompliance makes these expectations workable, you take into account the fact that some advice might not be followed with higher probability. (B) the \emph{no defiers} (terrible name, sinc eit is even stronger than that, uniform noncompliance might be a better term), is a sufficient condition to rule this out.}

\item make the payment for the $\beta r_a$ but do not require the payment of $b_{i-1}$.
\item make no payment, and require no payment.
\end{itemize}

Only the first is incentive compatible. TODO: formalize. Sketch: a crucial property is that w separate bids and reports, this lets the reports be truthful while the bids are shaded (as is standard in common value seccond price auction). Further, it means that noncompliance (given the no defiers assumption) 
\DBA{maybe I'm missing something. But if the subject has a strong tendency to pick low-reward actions, then the experts are disincentivized from providing any advice at all, since they will likely receive negative payouts}
\NDP{The prior is over the noncompliance (what you are terming it the tendency to pick low actions here) }


If we do not require the payment, it can incentivize experts to report in such a way as to encourage non-compliance, since this would increase their payout. \DBA{example}
If we void the payment completely this can have the oposite effect, biasing experts away from reporting the \DBA{Is this paragraph dependent on agent's having a model of the subject's noncompliance? E.g. If subject's noncompliance is random (ignore advice with probability $p$ and then pick action uniformly), are the second and third options incentive compatible?}






\section{The signal reporting vcg mechanism can work even when utilities are not part of the common prior}

the mechanism, but not necesarily the experts, needs access to the utility function of the decision maker and the prior over which expectations are taken 
\DBA{does the utility function of the decision maker (along with prior) ``explain'' its noncompliance? This is somehow a conceptual question, not sure if it makes a difference to the meat of the paper. }

for a cancer example; the chemiotherapy specialist might explain the likely side effects conditional on their knowledge of the specifics of the patient (the rapidly dropping cost of sequencing a genome means this) without needing to understand the relative value the patient places on discomfort relative to life lengthening, while the surgeon might explain the (again subject tot he specific characteristics of the subject) risks he foresees in the surgury (in contrast to the baseline risks of the populatin that gets the procude which is what cna be observed, a reasoable prior) for that patient, without needing to udnerstand the risk aversion of the patient which would be necesary for calculating their utility.

the subject (oracle style) can then be queried for their chosen action and expected utility for different subsets of the signals (for every expert we need to query what the action (and the expected payoff) would be without that experts signal having been reported)

contrast the information structure in the cancer example and its non separability 


\section{A bidding mehcnaism }

In many practical applications of interest, it might be that the signals can't be practically reported. For example, because while the expert knows something when they see it, they do not have a vocabulary to unambigously express it. 


If we replace the reports in the direct mechnaism by bids, and we allow the winner of the auction to pick the action, we have a mechanism that doesnt make any strong assumptions beyond that the agents understand the rules of the game.

For some information structures this still aggregates information well, for example:

\begin{lem}[specialist experts]
	if each expert knows the exact outcome conditonal on one action and knows he doesnt know what happens under other actions, and there is at least one expert that is informaed about each action.
\end{lem}

For other information structures it does not work, for exmaple 
\begin{eg}
	the classic example without separability that fails in the bayesian games so broadly (TODO Add cite) also fails here. 
\end{eg}

%\section{Summary}

\subsection{Interpreting bids}

the bids reflect the expected value of the mechanism choosing a particular action, not of that action being taken. \DBA{I'm confused. In previous section, ``each expert knows the exact outcome conditonal on one action'', and now its conditional on action being chosen, not taken. These sentences sentences seem to be at odds.} Example: if half are allways takers, the bid effectively waters down the true effect by half.
\DBA{So the bids made by experts depend on the expert's model of the subject's behavior?}

further, due to the winners curse, it is the expected effect conditional on having won the auction. 
\DBA{can you write down how expected conditional on having won is computed?}

\DBA{At this point, the interpretation of the bid has been qualified twice, and I'm lost}

\subsection{A sufficient separability condition for efficiency}

if each expert knows the value of a action the MSR and Void mechanism in the style of Hanson fail to be myopically incentive compatible when agents always follow the action whose price is maximal in the market (\cite{othman2010decision})



\section{Tradeoff between Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatible and Expressivity}



\section{Incentive Compatibility for Subjects}

One natural question given the bayesian incentive compatible bandit exploration literautre, is wether these mechanisms can work when all subjects are expected utility maximizers. If the experts bring enough information to bear, the answer is yes, and it can be so without hidding past subjects outcomes, if the experts bring sufficient information. Note however,that there are intermediate situations 

\subsection{A sufficient condition}

when the expert who won the auction selects and action, particularly in the early rounds she might be doing it becuase he wishes to explore, and thus the incentives
